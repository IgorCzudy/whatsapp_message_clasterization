" hey guys, does anyone know a good football club for erasmus students? is anyone playing here already?"
 Is anyone managing to play here?
 I'm also looking for a soccer team
 I applied for the university team
 At UCV
 where did you ask the question?
 can you only do that if you study there?
 I dont know
 does anyone know if there is a team of the upv or and to get into it?
 Yes
" In the upv they have some sort of leagues where the students can create their own teams with their classmates of friends from upv 
It starts in october"
 And i think to get in you have to do it from intranet
 well i am at uv so it doesn't work
" i only know for womens football, im going to train for a club here and applying for the uni team at ucv"
 Should we like try to find a football pitch and organise some games with each other?
 I’m in
 Good idea
 Yes
 Yess
 i would love that
 Do you know if there are any public grounds?
 i know that you can reserve some at the upv but i don’t know if it’s only for upv students and how easy it is and how big they are
 there is one just near estadi de l’atletisme del turia I think
 Yes that is very close to me
 I saw people playing the other day but I dont know if it is for public
 it should be I guess
 i called there and they said that it’s for everybody but you have to go there and register for the place like give the names of who’s using it and identification and stuff
 I think we should go as a group maybe?
 yeah
 Maybe tomorrow
 Who is down?
 If we arent able to enter we can go for a coffee or something
 i could do tomorrow but only a little later in the afternoon
 I’m in!
 Me too
 should we maybe create a separate group and everybody who wanna join us can enter the group ?
 I'am also down
 Me too
 Me too
 i can’t go tomorrow but i’m interested
 We should like book the ground the same day every week and we see who can and cannot attend
 Im also in
" Good idea, cause idk whether I‘ll be free tomorrow"
" Yes its a great idea , especially for the ones who are in the upv , because you can rent football pitches their for free for the students"
 They are 7vs7 pitches
 Can you maybe ask if students from other universities can play there?
 do you know if everyone can go there and just someone from the upv has to rent it or if only students can go there
" I dont think so , last year they sometimes the guys who work there enter and begins checking the upv ids"
 Yeah thats what I thought
" It is only allowed for upv students, thats the problem"
 There is a pitch 11vs11
 Well there is one pitch for 11v11 and it is divided by 2 for 7vs7
 But i think we can play 11vs11 if we manage to rent both pitches at the same time
 then let’s try the public one first where anyone can play
" Yes , i know one in Malvarosa , it can be rented for 7vs7 or 11vs11"
 7vs7 i think its 5 euros per person
 Perfect
 We can try to book that
 If we are 14
 For tomorrow ?
" Yes , of course"
 Yes for me it’s okay
 Me too
 me too
 Sounds good
 which time ?
 Ok for me
 👍🏼👍🏼
 Ok for me
 Tommorow sounds good
 When are you going to play? I am in too?
" For 7vs7 in upv tomorrow it is free all day from 8:00 until 19:00 
But if u want outside of upv , honestly i don't know if its possible tomorrow we might need to call them to check"
 I would have been down but if it’s in upv I don’t think I can go since I’m in ucv
" PEILING:
where should we play ?
OPTIE: the one in malverosa (‎0 stemmen)
OPTIE: estadi de l’atletisme del turia (‎7 stemmen)
OPTIE: try upv (‎10 stemmen)
"
" the ones who want to play at upv , at which time you think its better , the pitch is free from 8:00 to 19:00 and i think we can book 2 hours"
 17:00 - 19:00?
" I'm fine with that field too, but I don't know if we can if we're from the UV"
 you have to be from the uvp to play there?
 Yes
 Well you can but its a bit risky
 Because only upv students are allowed to play there
" So, can't we play on the other field?"
 Estadi de l’atletisme del turia or the one in malverosa
 So we get to 14 for sure for tomorrow
 In malverosa we have to pay is that ?
 .
 We should try it since not everyone is from upv
 Exact
" Yes i think so , but the problem is that i dont think we can play at it tomorrow"
 And pista de atletisme del turia i dont think their is a football pitch there
 Maybe we can play at one of the concrete pitches in the city?
" Yes this is a good idea , but in the summer its always full"
" The guys who are interested , can vote here ."
 We can try and call them
" The concrete ones are public pitches we dont need to call anyone , its the first who comes first to play"
 But the malvarosa one i think we can call them
 Okay
 We can try
 From 18:00 there is a tour in city of arts and science with ESN so we can play earlier
 is there a place for tomorrow?
 I’m a goalkeeper
" I don't think we will go tomorrow, it's too late"
 Why?
" I can still book the pitch in the upv , but we arent enough players"
 Exactly
 Should we try to meet us at a smaller free pitch in the city? We can do maybe a 5v5
 How many players are u
" There is so much people that we can easily play 7v7, it's better to wait and do it properly"
 Yes and if we are more we can make a little tournament with game of 10 minutes
 we're somewhere near 10
 yes i agree
 at upv we have 100% available pitch if we book it
 yes
 but you necessarily have to be a upv student to play there right ?
 Yes
 Not only the person who book pitch?
 Imo we can try tomorrow and in worst case we will go grab some beer or coffee
 No
 If I remember correctly the uv has got a football pitch too
 The guy at the welcome meeting said so
" alright I can’t play there, so if there is anybody who wants to play somewhere else, let me know"
" i’m down for it, maybe a concrete pitch somewhere"
" Yes there is a football pitch there too , and i think everyone can play there"
 I think a uv student who has to book it
 Well I'm a uv student I could try tomorrow
 Don't know how tho
 Or if it can be booked for the same day
 If I was going to play I would book in the UPV they normally only check the booker. They hardly go to the field and check everyone
 So if most of you are UPV you can play and if they come just say the UV ones are watching or hide them. They rarely come to to the field and check them all
 lets do that then
 Perfect
 At what time
 We can still play tomorrow but i think its too late
 Maybe monday
 We can organize it better
 Or on Sunday
 In the upv we can't on the weekends
 Ah fuck
 Or in a normal place in the city
" Why is it too late, you can still book it for tomorrow (today?"
 Its too late because we arent enough
 We're only 10 people i think
 For tomorrow I have to pass
 Because I won tickets for the game of levante so I would not make it
 but we could do that
 If we are 10 people
 In a normal place in the city i am not sure that we will find place to play there because due to the summer they're full all day
 I think its worth trying anyway
 Yeeeeees
 Lets tru
 Try*
 Or we can do a winners stays on with the other people
 where and when do we meet?
" good morning, does anyone know how the selections for the 11-a-side football team at UPV work?"
 You need to sign up for it from intranet
 In the competition section
 could you please send me the link?
 Ok
 and click on register
 We will play this afternoon or not ?
 There is a couple public football pitches near the beach
 I think we can try them
 What’s the invitation link for this group?
 Is someone up to go play here this afternoon?
 Its near Blasco Ibanez and its public
 Yes
 I’m in
 But does anybody has a football to play?
 Can you send the location please?
 I am in
 me too
 I m in
 https://maps.app.goo.gl/iMkTsBnX6CzezxyeA?g_st=iw
 Its here
 How about 6pm?
 5pm ?
 Both would be fine for me
 Someone has the ball to play?
 And can bring today
 can u send the adress the link doenst work for me
" Av. de Blasco Ibáñez, 148, 46022 València"
 What time do you guys prefer?
 Maybe everyone who want to go can write their preference
 at 5/5:30
 I agree
 i’ll join you at around 6:30
 It can be 5:30 for me
 For me too
 same
 ??
 I dont have one
 Me too
 We can buy some cheap one in a store nearby
 We do that
 Is there anyone here who would be down to go to the Levante UD vs. RCD Espanyol Barcelona Match?
 When is the game
 21h
 Today ?
" yes, but nevermind, I got a change of plans tonight. Maybe some other match?"
 Ok I would prefer to go to another match
 Maybe a valencia match
 I would also enjoy a visit at any stadium around here
 Me too
 Valencia Atletico Madrid
 16 september. We have to buy the ticket
 I would also like to go to a Valencia match in the stadium :)
" Tickets are very expensive now. I bought mine 1 week ago for 30euro, now it’s 70"
" Oof, so we should plan like a month ahead then I guess 😅"
 Tickets for the game against Sociedad are 25
 the cheapest one is like 70 euros i think
 i would probably suggest you guys the ones who want to go see a valencia match
" to go in a normal game not big games , like against barcelona or madrid because the prices are 3 times expensive"
 Let's go against sociedad
 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
" Yes, we can buy now the ticket"
 Maybe we'll take nearby seats
 If anyone wants @491792382982 and I have already bought tickets for Valencia Real Sociedad
 Gol gran alto 773 773: the position
 I bought the same ticket for valencia atletico madrid
 How much is it for gakencia real sociedad?
 Can you send the link please
 25 euro
 Yes
 https://entradas.valenciacf.com/valenciacf_webservices/es_ES/entradas/evento/31710/session/1856635/select?viewCode=V_blockmap_view
 I got a ticket as well
 I would like to join too
 If you want we are here
" Has any of you signed for the upv schools tryouts? Or do you know where I could ask for more information about it, like how many practices are there and at what time"
 Yes I have
 I’ll try and find and I’ll send you
 The practice is tomorrow at 14:00
 You play for like 1 or 1 hour and a half
 And then next week the send the list of the players for tge new season
 They train every week on tuesday at 14:00 
 chapter 7
 Does anyone know if we have the same at uv?
 Looks really interesting
" Thank you so much! I have class at 15, so I have to see if I can change it. Would be awesome to play but we’ll see"
 Is tomorrow the only chance to make it to the team?
 I think so

 Is the pitch too small for 7v7 because we have enough if we wanna do that?
 Yes is for 5vs5 🥲
" No, in the upv 7vs7 pitch sometimes we play 8vs8"
 And its enough
 Next week we csn try a 7vs7
 In the big pitch
 Okay sounds good
 The 7vs7 pitch is  the half of a 11vs11 potch
 Perfect
 5vs5 is the good size for start 🤣
 You think you’ll be tired?🤣

 Okay

 No

 Okay ill go
" So do y'all confirm we'll play tomorrow after 3 pm? Cause I do, only got classes up until 2"

 Is it true non upv students can pay €3 to play there?
 I've never heard that tbh
 this is going to be futbol sala in artificial grass or in cancha de cemento
 Idk

 por eso traje los zapatos para ese pasto
 In the pitch
 yeah which one
 Yes which one

 Can we organize a match NOT in the UPV field for this weekend?
 ok
 lets try
 but where
 We search a field
 We are in 3 now
 Present
 Im am free on Sunday
 If you find a turf pitch
 Hopefully
 I've seen that uv has got pitch too
 We need to pay though and ask for tuem
 Them*
 I dont think it is a huge fee
 But there are many polideportivos throughout the city
 If we meet 2 times a week its good
 Yeah me neither
 I mean I can pay something divided by 7-10
 Everyone can I think
 It cannot be that high of a price
 You found a place?
 Because I also would like to watch it :)

 If not we book this again but we pay 3.8 each. it is fine for me
 I know one but its 5euros per person 😅 so more expensive than this one
 It’s okay for me
 But this one looks better
 Okay but before booking this time I would like the screens of the bank transfers. Because if I receive 3.80 euros from everyone then I have too many coins that I never use
 Tell me if you’re okay
 I'll put the ✅ when you send me the screenshot of the bank transfer made

 My bad
" We see here at 6pm guys today
https://maps.app.goo.gl/iZiCfvw5QSViiuxf8?g_st=iw"
 Will I be able to get in normally even if I'm not from upv?
 Or should I wait for somebody to get in together?
 Vieni fuori del mio dipartimento e andiamo assieme
" locatie: https://maps.google.com/?q=39.48358917236328,-0.34493735432624817"
 Finisco alle 5
 Okk pur io
 Quello di belle arti no?
 Appost io il tempo di arrivare da blasco ibáñez
 Si
 Okk a dopo
" It's my first time joining, how can I get in?"
 Go to the pitch dont worry
 If anyone wants to see Valencia Barcelona in December Adrian and I will buy tickets nearby tomorrow at the field
 Do you know the price?
" It's expensive, it costs 85, but I'll take it because as a Sampdoria fan I'll never see Barcelona live😅"
 Qualche anno fa fecero Sampdoria Barcellona se non ricordo male
 Al trofeo Gamper
 Sì ne abbiamo fatti 2 o 3. Però ero piccolo non ci sono andato al camp nou
 Uno lo abbiamo anche vinto 1-0 con gol di Soriano dopo 40 secondi
 Eh manch'io purtroppo
 Che mito
" Fossi nato 20 anni prima mi vedevo anche la finale di champions league a Wembley, ma purtroppo sono nato nell’era Ferrero🥲"
 Spero possiate tornare presto! 🫶🏽

 We are late we arrive
 Iam also late thought we are playing at UPV
 Coming with Kylian in 1min
 We are arriving in 2 minutes
 Maybe is here someone from Marseille and could help me? I can't buy a ticket for the OM game on Sunday because of an error that I don't know how to solve. 😔
 It’s this match ?
 Yes
 I tried to pay by 5 different cards and always payment were refused from the site
 It’s written that if you want a ticket you have to find a reseller cause it’s saying that it’s already full
 Yes. I found the ticket from resell on the site
 Oh okok
 But at the check-out always my payment is refused
 Have you tried with another reseller ?
 I tried from different resellers and ticket categories and nothing
 Its possible that someone at the fan shop will help me with this or I have to try by myself?
 If you want an advice
 As a very objective football fan
 You should rather spend your money in hoes than go watch the shit club that marseille is
 🤡🤡
 😘
 4-1
 COME ON PARIS
 Ok but 4-0 against you
 😂😂😂
" Yes, i know. They're shit right now but I'm not a footix. I'm a supporter since always haha"
 Thank you❤️
 Im kidding I’m just a Paris fan hahahah
 Go enjoy one of the best crowd in the world
" Guys, after the next game we play, we'll go get something to eat and drink somewhere, okay?"

 Sure
 Do you have credit card?

 Where are you Guys ?
" We went back home now, we were at saint patrick"
 OK stay at saimt patrick or you go Home now
 We got home 5 minutes ago
 OK No Stress 🤟
 Does someone know if St Patricks also shows football matches today or only Rugby?
 I don't think they will.. when there's rugby they show it on every screen
" But you can maybe send them a message, also to San Patrick scholars that is close to upv"
 I dont think st patricks is the best for tonight
 Okaay
 Alguien como algun plan esta noche?
 Indiana es bueno hoy

 HAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAA
 Bro which is your team? Debrecen?
 Fehérvár👍🏼
 Ah okay
 This Debrecen was very very strong
 Dominated the league
 Since then they had second league years too
 Next time I will be gambling on debrecen
 Ahahahahhaha
 We played 3-3 with some maltese team a few years ago
 Yes bro I remember this game
 Do you know this guy?
 Vamos
 Brooo of course
 one of the poorest players I've seen play at the stadium😂
 Yea he is a meme in hungary too😂😂
" I dont know him, but i think i heard about him"
 He played in like 15 clubs so probably he wasnt the best player
 Exactly😂
 I have to scroll down to see all the clubs he has ever played in
 We had an Italian guy in hungary who i think was in prison in italy for some gambling fraud
" I know him, I think is a good striker"
 He was one of the best player i have ever see in the hungarian league
 So many memories about him
 He could have a much better carreer if he wasnt into gambling in his own matches hahaha
 For sure man
 If you heard a madman screaming in the Blasco Ibáñez area it's because Fabio Borini scored
 AHAHAHAHAH
 Im going to leave home
 I’m late. I’ll arrive at 9:15
 Someone there?
 I will be late
 Me myself and I
 I’ll be there in 30 minutes

 Buaa jope
 I do something with friends but we are like 25 so I think we should join together at 1 or 2 am near to the club ?
 No sé podría meter a 7 personas más y hacer cambios o alquilar dos campos a la vez o algo así?
 Okay bro
" Seguro que puedes reservar otro campo (el problema es que hay muy pocas plazas libres cada semana), pero tener sustitutos para un partido que dura sólo una hora no tiene sentido."
 This is what happens when I left the phone for one hour 😂
 Anyway if someone quit just put me in 🤙🏻
" Si alguien quiere jugar después de las 20:00. A hacer dos equipos y reservar un campo, podríamos intentarlo."
 Quiene esta interesado para jugar despues ?
 Missed it again shit
 Rt
 Me too👍🏻
" I many people missed it, maybe we can rent another pitch"
 if u want we can try to do and if we fill all the 14 rent the pitch
 and if any want to play 2 times and burn all tomorrows alcohol👀
 I can be there in case
