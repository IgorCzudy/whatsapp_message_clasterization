" Sorry guys I have a question, at Gandia Campus when is the welcome day to take our ESNcard?"
" Buenos días, algunos de vosotros practicáis natación y/o boxeo en la UPV, me gustaría preguntaros alguna información sobre los cursos."
" Hiii, sadly Gandía does not invite us to their welcome day, but you can get the ESNcard at UPV Office any day"
 You'll be able to come to our amazing trips and actividades
 Perfect thank you
 Alguien de esn está en el Centro de idiomas? Porque estoy aquí pero no veo nadie de esn😅
 What dose the esn car offre?
 Offer?
 X2
 Exchange students in Gandia have to start lessons the 11th or After the welcome day the 14th?
" Hey guys, do you know where we can do sailing lessons in Valencia / golf?"
 it offers a lot of discounts and also you can come to our trips and activities
 Until what time you are in the office please?
 Also can I pay with bankcard?
 One of the main discounts the card can offer is the Ryanair one: 10% discount in 4 flights and a free luggage 25kg max. Also you can check esncard.org and look for all the discounts you can get
 Yesss ofc
 ?
 No idea🥲. I'd recommend you to send an email to the university
 what are the opening hours of the ESN office to buy the card?
" It's on our Instagram, today is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."
 It depends on the university you go to
" I'm not sure, but I would say you start on the 11th"
" I sent an email, I hope they will reply soon"
 Is the beerpong event tonight already booked out? Because it’s not possible to register online

" The ESN welcome party tonight is 🆓, isn't it?"
 but you need an ESNcard
 do we need to register before? or is it enough to just go there and show up your card?
 Oh without card can’t we enter? Or should we pay at the entrance etc.
 What if I went this morning take my card but there were too many people so I just got registered but couldn’t get it ?
 You need to register
 Oh sorry I thought you were talking about registering for the ESNcard
" no, i already got it :)"
 So no problem then
 so just show up with the card would be enough? :)
 Yep
" I registered online but at the office they told they were closing and couldn't get one, I suppose can't got to the party, right?"
 Is anybody still at the beach?
" No unfortunately not, but I probably will go tomorrow morning (around 10) if anyone wants to join"
 😊
 YOU DON'T NEED YOUR ESNCARD TO ENTER BAMBOO FOR FREE
 Alright thanks
 And the other party as well I suppose
" Party at bamboo: free entrance, with the ESNcard you get a free shot, that's it 
Party at Indiana: with the ESNcard you have free entrance till 1:00"
" Hey, is there someone in the city centre up for a drink or walk around? We are two"
 Remember for tonight to bring you ESNCard with you!!!
" Btw, what is the bracelet for from the welcome pack?"
" it's just a gift we give to you for getting the ESNcard, up to you if you wanna wearing it or just keeping it 😄"
 Is it already possible to get the welcome package?😊
 Sure you can come anyday to the office when it's open

 Until when can I still go take my card a the office today ?
 Which uni?
 At the centro de idiomas
 Until 12
 Ok thanks
 Hey does anybody have an advice where to get your own bike from (long-term rent or buying)?
 at upv until 13? or did the times change?
 Yes! UPV Office from 11:30 until 13:00
 okay thanks:)
 I rented at MONBIKE starting from €20 a month. It is a minimum of 3 months. I think it is a nice place.
 Where can I get the ESN bag?
 I asked at some bike/repair shops if they have a second hand bike to sell and most of them had some
 Do you know if it’s expensive?
 When you get an ESNcard they should give you one
" hard to say, really depending on the bikes… But yes, some were too expensive I thought, but I found one in the end!"
" Maybe ESN has a discount with bikes, I know we had before"
 Take a look at the partners on the ESN web
 vuelta de turca was the shop but I think it was the last second hand bike they had available in the moment
" If anyone is interested, we will go at 2 pm"
" hahaha okay, but thank you!!!🥰"
" If you got the esncard with UV maybe we didn't have enough welcome packs at that moment, in that case we must have given you a paper with which you can come to our office to pick your welcome pack 😊"
" do you know if it’s safe to let your bike outside in València? i mean a second hand one, not too fancy"
 To get the esn card can I pay with card? 
 If you leave It with a lock It should be fine
 Good question
 Yes
" For the bike question, how is Valenbisi?"
 Do I have to pick up the esn card myself? Or can a friend pick mine up for me?
" I would only use a U shape lock grabbing the body and wheel, otherwise it's possible to break it"
 You can see the corpses of stolen bikes around the city 😂
 Nope..
 Exactly 😅 unless you can lock EVERYTHING...
 Very nice but might not be suitable for going to university as they won’t be places to parc it
 There aren't many?
" Hi, I will be an erasmus in the CEU university 
Can I still get the ESNcard even if there is no ESN section in CEU university?"
 Yesss! You can!😄
 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
 Yes there are many. But keep in mind that many students use it and they all come at round about the same time to university
 where?
 in which sections?
" It's convenient to go around the city. But compared to a normal bike, it is quite heavy🤣"
" You can always check the app to see free spots closer to the uni.. but yeah, the closest are usually full"
 Dit bericht is verwijderd
 What do you have to bring to get your esn card? Just the money? 😄
 You can choose
 And id or passport if possible
" If you are from a uni without ESN, any ESN can make your ESNcard"
 Do I need my student card to register for the sport courses?
 Is the Upv office open this afternoon too?
 Yesss! From 16:30 until 18:00 🕐
 Anyone recommendations for getting a cheap second hand bike?
 Where can we sign up for the Montanejos Trip? Or is it already full?
 It's already full 😢
 cash converters
" What you mean, there are valenbisi parking lots everywhere"
 And it's only 30€ for an entire year
 And you don't have to worry about it getting stolen
 Besides if you manage to arrive to your destination in less than 30 minutes it's free
 Otherwise it's 52 cents
 and we have to go in an office ?
 It's all done online
 Just need to download an app
 you can also just leave the bike at the station before you get to 30 min and then get the same one immediately hahaha
 Yeah exactly
 Valenbisi https://www.valenbisi.es/en/home
 Yes but in UPV/Tarongers campus it can be difficult to find a free spot in lecture days 🥲
" This has probably been asked before, but do you have to have an Erasmus life card to join trips? 

It won't let me create an account, and was thinking about joining the Alicante trip tomorrow but I might be too late then."
 Take valenbisi for more or less 30€ you can take them wherever you are
 The city is full
" We are not that company, we are ESN, volunteers,, and you would need our ESNcard to join, yep"
 Maybe just go to their store or ask them via Instagram....
" Smart, thanks!"
" Sorry guys, is there anyone who wants to make a change of appointment for the metro card? Mine is September 18 but I will not be here so an appointment a few days later is fine too"
 Is that the free one ?
 Yeah only problem is you cannot always park them
 Yeah
 It doesnt matter if you dont come on the selected hours right? Cuz todsy I checked and you gotta pick the pickup point ajd hours yea?
 How do you make an appointment?
 https://www.metrovalencia.es/es/cita-previa/
 Thank you!
" Hi, if its possible i could take your appointment, i have one on the 2nd of october"
" They are everywhere, I am just saying that at uni the lots will be all taken during uni time or it will be difficult at least. That’s just the information I got from some officials :)"
" I'm not sure if you can exchange it, since they'll ask for your ID 🤔"
 Can I have the ESN card if I am not in the University of Valencia ?
 Yes
 Ok thanks
 Any tips on where to get a photo to put on the ESN card? 😅
 In the Amistat metro station there's a photobooth
" Also in Facultats, or at least there was one"
 if you have a photo on your mobile you can print it in rossmann
" If you go there choose the Vintage pictures, they're tinted but cheaper than the passport pictures and you get multiple attempts xD"
 That's the true spanish spirit hahahahha
" Hello, we've just arrived, we haven't yet done the ESN card. Is it possible to attend tonight's party at Havanas clubs?"
 What clubs can you enter without the ESN card? I don’t have it yet either :((
" You can go into the club, but you'll have to pay I'm afraid😕. To Havana club today you have free entrance with your ESNcard until 1:00 am"
 I got a bike on wallapop App (like Ebay) for 85€ and it’s a beautiful road bike can recommend the app
 Someone on the beach?
" Yes, between number 5&6"
 Can you maybe send me your location?
 We'll be there in a few minutes late to the oceanography
 Nosotros también estamos llegando
 May i ask  where Is the meeting tour for the today's tour of the city?

" Hey, anyone at UV having issues paying the 7 Euro matriculation fee o line? Is the server down or something?"
 How do you pay for it ?
 I don't remember if a few days ago there was a news that this weekend they were going to update the page or do something
 You need to pay for it??
" I just know that us medical students got an email which includes a note that we have to pay 7 euros online with a credit card until the 11th, but I tried it and it doesn't seem to work 🤷‍♀️"
" You have to go in the intranet, in ""Secretaria Virtual"" and then ""Estudiante - Consulta Recibos"" and you can pay online"
 I still haven't understood where should we book things
 Yess
 So I can book today for the 22nd?
 In your section's website
 Yup
 Alright perfect! Cause last time I checked http://esnuv.org it didn't work
" But know it does, thanks!"
 Should be fine by now
 Yeah sorry we had some problems 🥲
" De nada, gracias 🫶🏽"
" If someone wants to join at the beach, we are at Malvarosa! At the left of number nine!"
 I think you have to upload the photo and then they'll make the card for you
" I will join in ~40 minutes, hope you will still be there 😅"
 Do I need to have the ESNcard from ESN Valencia UPV to attend the events? I’m coming from another section and already have a card🤔
 I tried to book a place to the bouldering event but the system rejected it
" No you don't need a new one, I had the same situation. You need to register and go to the office so they add your card to the system and it's done 😉"
" Ohh, okay great🙈"
 Is the next possible time to pick up the card at the UV next Wednesday or is there a way to get it earlier?

 I think that you cannot follow both courses but you have to choose one of them
 Anybody has a link to the dance classes on Wednesday?
 I think it’s through an Erasmuslife link
 Anyway it’s normally fridays and saturdays
" You will have to drop one of these and select new one on the university system, before you drop any of courses- you must confirm it with your home university, and get new LA signed from both sides. 

But, don’t worry first 2 weeks like orientation stuff. You join classes and try to change if you dont like(with home university confirmation,LA)."
 Hi everybody! Someone could tell me where is esn office and when it is open?
 check their ig
 I was wondering what you are talking about. Any dancing class available?
 You can look at university sports

" Hello everyone! I'm looking for flatmates for the apartment I've moved in El Carmen, write me in private if you're interested! "
 To do the searching is horrible cause you don't have pictures or anything. But usually you deal directly with the owners so no real state fee there

 Hi! Someone talked about a quiz before. What is the quiz about and how will it go?
 Dit bericht is verwijderd
" Oh, nice, thanks. And do you know what it is gonna be about? Like any topic there?"
 And the format of the questions?)
 There is a way to find out🌚
 #nospoiler
" just in case you didn't know yet: if you've got yourself an ESNcard check out our website esncard.org and register your card there! You will get many discounts, including 10% off on RyanAir flights as well as free luggage! So make sure to make the most out of your card :) If you have any questions feel free to ask in here or write me a DM 🫶🏻"
 BBVA accepts opening a bank account with international passport
" hi guys, do you know when and where is the don@ event (donation opportunities for newcomers) this week? I can’t find any information on the internet/social medias"
 Check our highlight stories!! 😁😋 
 thank you! I didn't know it was an esn event too :)
" There are being some problems with the data base and you might receive offers from other ESN sections which are not in Valencia, we are trying to fix that ASAP"
 ok I'll wait
" But it's gonna take more than today hahaha, I mean it should get fixed by the end of this month (I hope)"
" Yeah this is not from Valencia so don't pay attention to that. We don't usually send our activities and discounts by email, you can see everything in our social media"
 Which social media can I find information about the events?
" Instagram, esn websites"
 Facebook too
" ESN en UV --> instagram.com/esnenuv
ESN Valencia UPV --> instagram.com/esnvalenciaupv
ESN UCV --> Instagram.com/esn.ucv"

" Guys if I’ve reserved the card with ESN UPV, can I take it also from UV office?"
" Noup, if you study at UPV you have to get your card at UPV"
" If you study at UV, you have to get it at UV. And if you study at UCV, you have to get it at UCV"
" For those who study in a different university, you can choose "
 No. You should fill in the form again in the corresponding section
 The ESN UPV office is open this afternoon from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
 Hi I've got this message when I looked up the ryanair discount in esncard.org:
 Is this because i just created the account or something else is the problem
 Is the climbing today a course or just climbing together?
 Becaue I think the entry is less than 13€ normally ...
" you are at ""the economist"" :) you have to go to the ryanair section"
" I'll explain, we're all going together, it's €10 and €3 for climbing shoes"
" it's climbing together, but for people who are not beginners
And the price is 13€ if you don't have an ESNcard and need to borrow shoes, which are 3€
Entrance is 10€ without ESNcard and with 8-9€"
 OH yes fair but the ryanair page is the same
 Ah ok great 🔥
 Did you register your card?
 I am in :)
 write me in private
" the Ryanair part of our website seems to be down! But you can still access the discount! All you need to do is go to the Ryanair website, log in to your profile, click on the erasmus tab on the left side and then enter the same information that you entered when registering your ESNcard. After that you should have access to the discount 🫰🏻"
 I study in another one so it’s not relevant?
 Not really
 Ok Perfect
" So I’ll ask my friend that goes to UV to take it for me even if I wrote UPV, right?"
 But you have to go pick it up in the uni that you registered
" If you want to pick it up in UV you'll have to fill our form, that's it "
 Oh shit
 I put the wrong one
" It's ok, you can fill it again"
 Making the forms is a second
 Ok Perfect
 Thanks both of you!

 Oh got it ! Thanks 🙏🏼

 How do I get the esn card?
 Hi
 I have got a question
" Hi! If I haven’t got a ESN card, I come without and buy on this event?"
 I cant go to your office because i have lessons
 ?
" Good morning everyone!
There has been some escape room scheduled today. Has it been canceled?"
 Noo
" But we've changed the location, its in calle de Sevilla 13"
 In cronos local
 And you can only come if you booked your spot previously
 Is it possible to book now?
" And if so, where?)"
 I dont thanks so :(
 We sent the participants yesterday
" Oh, gosh. Thanks. It was quite unclear that you should register and where to do it."
 I'm sorry to hear that
" But for most events that you need to pay for, you must go tp your ESN Office to buy it"
 We Will do another one the 24th so stay tuned for that one :)
 25th*
" Hey, does someone know in what building business English is held today? Aula 314 Aulari Sud"
 You can only buy the card in our office
 Maybe we'll open some afternoons so if you can't come in the morning just wait for next week's schedule
 Hi everyone! Does someone know how to sign for activities in UV? The enrolment starts today at 11 but I’m not sure if I have to do it online or in person
 Maybe someone also is going to take some sports activities and can help me 🥺
" Hello!!, There is always a contact phone number or an email, you usually ask there to go to the first class and if you like it you can ask the teacher to sign up"
 But on the sports page I think you can sign up
 Ohh I don’t know how to do it actually ;(( I tried different ways. I guess I have to wait till 11? Idk
" I will try that way, thank you"
 You can look for different sport courses here: https://secvirtual.uv.es/p/pls/uv0/public_cursose.ofertacursos?idioma=I&wcentro=S32
" Then you click on the course you want to enroll and click ""access to self enrollment"" and it'll redirect you to another link"
 Wooow thank you so much 🥰

" *Remember that for the Paella on Thursday you need the ESN Card, if you have signed up and you don't have the card you won't be able to have dinner, so go to the office these days to get it*  ☺️☺️"
 Hi! How does It work for signing up for up coming events?
" Hi, are there discounts offer on ASLA buses with ESN card?"
 you can log into Instagram stories or Facebook to see events and activities and there is usually a link if needed. And then depending on where you got your ESN card you look on the ESN website at the events 😁
 yesss
" I'm sorry but I'd like to sign for paella night but I can't
On the site I can only see 2 actividades (yoga aerial y art in the park)"
" paella is sold out sorry🫣we will do more international dinners, don't worry, but you can still come to the party"
 remember to sign up for activities as soon as possible so as not to miss out on a place!
" for example for painting in the park while eating we also have limited places, I recommend you to buy it as soon as possible😄😄"
 you get food and drink while you paint and meet all the other artists hahah
 https://www.esn-spain.org/partners/alsa yesss!
" The ESN UCV website has no activity, so where should I sign?"
 Nein
" I reserved a seat for aerial yoga but I couldn't pay since it's only in presence. Now I see from the ig story that it's sold out, so I don't have a place anymory since I couldn't pay. Is that correct?
If so, could you put the possibility to pay online? It's not very convenient to have to come to the office everytime since I'm not in the campus"
" We dont sell online.. but if you are never going to be able to pay in our office .. the boulder center offers the aerial yoga without ESN as well, so feel free to contact them on Instagram @camaleonboulder"
 All sections are working on the pay online option but it's hard because it doesn't depend on us. It depends on the bank. And banks are slow with paperwork 
" I had the same, so if I just signed up and got a confirmation via mail does it mean I got a place or only after coming by the office?"
" That's the thing. It's not as easy as it seems to add online payments. Until this course we worked with an app called Verse which allowed online payments,  buuut unfortunately for us, they closed the app🫠. So we're still looking for a new platform for it. We're so sorry for the inconveniences 🥺"
" So, for now, the only option is visiting our offices in order to pay"
 ??
" Do you also require booking&paying in advance for the cinema tomorrow, or can I just purchase a ticket when I'm there? I can't find any information on that, also not on the ESN website"
 Only after you pay for it. In the Esn valencia upv website it is explained in the events page
" Is the oceanografic 22.09. at 17:00h or 11:00h?
The short infobox says 17:00h but in the text it's 11:00h"
 17:00h sorry
" Feels like I'm lost in the dark.)))
Could someone tell me, please, where I can register for the city tour on the 16th and the oceanographic on the 22nd?"
 Okok! Hope it solves! Thx for your work 🫶🏼
" For the city tour you don't have to sign up anywhere, you go there and that's it😊 For the oceanografic, look on the website depending on which university you are at, enter ESN en UV or ESN Valencia UPV or ESN UCV and register for the oceanografic, then go to the office to pay"
 Gracias.)
 Would you mind sending a link of the page of the event from ESN UCV? Sorry for bothering you that much... I just (who knows why) cannot see anything on the site: it is just blank.
" Don't worry about asking! They will not have updated their page, try talking to them on Instagram or go to their office to ask"
" If anyone has questions, you can always go to the office to talk about any topic!"
" UPV
https://esnvalenciaupv.org/eventos
UV
https://esnuv.org/esn-events (It's not on their website, ask them on Instagram or at office)
UCV
https://esnucv.org/eventos (Same as UV)"
 With the ESN card do we have a discount in movelia buses or just Alsa? 🚌
 Just ALSA
 How do I get an new esn card? Since mine was stolen :)
 is the ESN at centre d’idiomes open in the afternoon?
 Depends on the uni
" Not this week, but maybe next week it will be open in the afternoons"
 perfect thank you!
 There is no foto on my esn card. Can I just use it without the foto?
" For us ESN is not compulsory, but if at any moment a partner asks for it and you don't have it, they have the right to deny you the discounts"
 it is highly recomended
 How can you get the esn card?
 you have tocome to our office
 well depending where you study it will be an office or other haha
 Ah oke thank you!

 Alguien sabe si a la cita para la matrícula tenemos que decir los cursos de todo el año o solo del primer cuatrimestre?
 Does anybody know if at the enrolment appointment we'll need to say all the classes we want to attend for the entire year or just the first term?
" It depends on your erasmus time. If you should come back at the end of the firs semester, you should select first semester because exams gonna be in january."
" As I know if you are gonna be here whole year, you can select both"
" I'm gonna stay here until july, I'm wondering if I'll need to lay out to them my entire learning agreement or if there's gonna be another appointment in January for the second term"
 I'm not talking about selecting anything (?)
 Cause I don't know about groups of some courses cause they don't appear on the site
 Maybe cause it's too early
 Yesss
 It depends on the university you study
 Oh got it know.
 I’m not sure about it
" oh UV, campus dels tarongers"

" You will have to buy the ESN card if you do not have it and then fill out a form that is on the 'ESN en UV' website, and pay for the activity"
 If you have the ESN card you will have discounts and you could go to all the activities you want 🤭🤭
" If we have visitors that also do/did their Erasmus in different cities and have a valid esn card, can they also register for events?"

 Hi guys! The question was probably asked but I couldn't find it in the chat. How can I get an ESN card if I do the internship not connected to any of the universities?
 You can just come to any office you like and make it!
 Nice! Thank you!
" I need to have physical copy of my photo with me, right?"
 Any plan for tonight party?
" ideally yes, but it's not required. Though, the sooner you put a picture on your ESNcard the better :)"

" Just you passport and you have to show the email that you got the appointment, thats it"
 Thanks!
" I have the same problem. I'm in group 4A2.
Anyone want to swap? Would prefer any other A2 group"
 Are there groups for football?
" Yes, in ESN community you can find it"
 Next to the name of this group
 I’m in 1A2 but I prefer the 4A2. So i could swap
 I don't know if it's my problem but I can't see anything about football 🥲
" Yes, that would be Great"
 Hey where is this Don@'s Event on the UPV Campus? We can't find it
 I guess la casa del alumno
 4K
" Yeah 👍 Casa Del Alumno, ground floor"
" Hello guys! 
Does anyone know any places to fix laptop? My laptop now seem to have screen burn problem 🥲 idk where to go"
" In ESN we know all of us are different; different cultures, lifestyles, preferences, and that richness is also a good thing.

That is why we would like to offer you a wide spectrum of parties. Not the usual Valencian mental image that probably you have of only reggaeton discos and pubs (they are perfect of course).

Next friday 15th we will have a Party in Indiana disco (Reggaeton & commercial) 🔊🎶🪩🕺🏻💃🏻
And saturday 16th meeting point at Espit Chupitos pub to play some drinking games and dance commercial music

but also...

Next weekend there's a 🏠 House Music Collective called ""The Basement"" that with ESN and your ESNCard will offer discounts in their parties, they made parties each time in different locations.

The first festival is this one:

https://thebasementxxx.com/webapp/tickets/#/en/event/dias-de-parque-by-thebasement-polo-fest--130483

Since most of you still don't have the ESNCard, we implemented another way to discount

enter the promo code *ESN* 
and it will appear a special offer with 5€ of discount for the festival 2-days ticket.

🎛️🎚️

See you there!"
" Puerta principal de la Casa del Alumno, creo"
 Don’t you need to book for that?
" No, just go to the meeting point which is the Oceanografic Main entrance"

 *place
" Casa Del Alumno, Ground Floor"
" The tour started at 12:45 in Casa del Alumno Main Entrance and finished  around 14:00. Sorry for not sharing the live location, I forgot 😅. We mostly walked around, explained the sports facilities, library and Casa del Alumno. If you have doubts feel free to ask here :)"

 Yeah! You can choose whatever you want
" Yess, you can still get it at any of the ESNs in Valencia"
 Where is the tour??
 It started at six at the oceanografic
" which one is better ? uv, upv or ucv ?"
 The closest ESN office you have is the best
" We a are a team, doesnt matter 😂"
" Exactly there is no better than other. The only thing would be that depending on where you get the card, you'll have to sign up there for the trips and activities (which are organised together)"
 😂
 😮😮😮😮 why do you have that sticker 😮
 ok so all the things organized by the ESN sections are the same ? and same prices ?

 You have to first register the card with esn amd then you can add it to your ryan air account
" Yes I know the steps but some people have followed them and it still doesn't work. I just want to make sure that it is working for everyone else that got the ESNCard this semester to see if it's our fault or Ryanair's one. So if anyone got the ESNCard and can confirm that it works, it would help a lot. Thank you :)"
" Yeah, I did it and it is working. You need to check whether all the data you have written is the same as in this side with registration"

For all people who are at Burjassot campus and study Biology, lifescience, pharmacy or something like that :)"
 Nah don’t worry
 Really? I am really anxious about it
 Are you a student of uv also?
" Ask him to see the room on person, if he doesn't let you see it maybe it is a scam"
 Also normally it's a good advice not to pay any money in advance before seeing the room.
 How much discount do we have ?

 What uni ?
 Upv
" Tbh no, there isn’t"
 Bocalinda is okay
 But there are some cafes in the middle of campus
 Oh right
 I Like that one
 Do you know whether they'll show all the CL games?
 I dont think they'll show all of them at the same time
 But they'll probably show the most interesting ones
 Like milan vs newcastle or psg vs dortmund
 Heyyyyy
 Tomorrow its the last day for pay the oceanografic
 Dont miss it!
 A che ora è il 22?
 Hey can you pick up your free public transport pass anyday after the appointment or is it supposed to be strictly the day of registration?
 Because i accidentally missed it
 The temporal Jove metro Valencia card
 Alle 13:00 all'ingresso principale dell'Oceanografic
 You have to make an appointment again
 I had it at 10 in the morning and I went in the afternoon the same day because I also forgot and they told me I had to make another appointment!
 Aweee :(
 Is it confirmed tonight at natura dub?
 Every Tuesday is Natura day🌚
" I dont know if somebody already asked, 


is it possibile for one person to get the free abono jove (free public transport) for him and another person?
We got the reservation via mail "
" I think it is not possible, they ask you for the original ID/Passport to verify the data"
 Does the natura night get cancelled if it rains?
" Noo, you can come and have some drinks with us!"
 If you have the other person's confirmation and ID I think it says in the confirmation mail that it is possible
 Alright thanks
 Well it depends on how much it rains hahahha
" please text me, very important 🙏"
 do you guys know where i can buy good protein powder?

 I bought It here and It was not that expensive and a lot of options
 thanks good to know
 I prefer going to a store bc i dont know if ordering to our flat is a good idea
 You can send the package to picking points as well. I usually do that cause I'm not at home most of the day
" I buy it here because it's the closest one to me and the other ones I have gone to are closed most of the time

 @admins Will there be a WhatsApp group for surfing as well? 🌚
 Will there be a trip to montanejos this sunday with esn?
 Suggest it
 No
 Where can we see where they are?
" They use NACEX to make the delivery. I don't remember the process. I don't know if you could pick the point right away or you change the point with a link that they send to your phone.
But I always buy on that store and I always pick up the products that way.
But since I usually buy in bulk I don't buy that often"
 Ohh okok

 Do you have any issue?
 Let me know if you need help
 I tried to book but ESN of Valencia doesn't have a discount. Or at least I didn't find it
" Ryanair is an international partner of ESN, so if you have an active ESNcard you have acces to the discount"
" If you try to book, there's a list of ESN universities and I didn't find valencia’s"
 I think there's an issue with the Ryanair x ESN cooperation currently. Quite a few people don't seem to be managing to book flights
" ah, not sure which list you're referring to but anyone with an ESNcard can use the discount, as long as it's registered on esncard.org as well before trying to book flights"
 The problem I encountered was people not logging into esncard.org or not creating it with the right details
" I'll take a look in a couple of hours, thank you!"
 The 10% discount and free extra luggage also has some conditions in Ryanair's website. I think it said you have to add the esncard to ryanair and the flight has to be booked 28 days in advance
 I tried to put the ESN card into the Rayanair account but it gave me an error
" 1st step: Register on esncard.org
2nd step: fill in the same info filled on Ryanair's website"
" If you try to register on Ryanair first, it'll say your info doesn't match"
 Yeah i don’t know where to click to get to Rayn air via ESN?
" Go to your Ryanair account profile, then on the left side you'll see an  *Erasmus* tab"
 There you have to set the info you fill on esncard.org 
 done
 and then you use the *exact same* info on the ryanair website as well

 Sorry Im sure this question was already here but cant find it atm: whats the cheapest / best way to go to madrid and where to buy tickets?
" You can go buy bus or train, in my opinion bus is cheaper but takes longer. Also you have discount with your ESNcard with ALSA buses"
" Buses are not necessarily cheaper, I always go to Madrid by train. If you buy the tickets soon enough you can find them for less than 20€, especially if the trip is during the weekdays. I recommend Iryo or Ouigo, they're cheap companies, and this is the website I use to compare prices thetrainline.com"
 By train you can be in Madrid in less than 2 hours and it's more comfortable
" +1
I found train tickets for 11€ from one of these too and it was for the weekend"
 True I just never plan soon enough 😂
 Such true words 🥲
" Hi, how can I take the appointment for doing the ESN card?"
" Depending on the uni you study, you have to register on the website and then visit the office to pick it up"
 UV
 There’re open until 12 today
 Then you have to register here: https://esnuv.org/esncard
 And then visit our office to get your card☺️
" As he said, today we're open till 12. Otherwise, tomorrow from 10 to 12, we'll be here☺️"
 I have to put my address of here in Valencia or of my country?
 Here
 Alguien sabe si para obtener el descuento del 10% en buses de ALSA el ticket debe costar más de 20 euros?
 Es que voy a comprar uno de 18 y no se me ve reflejado
 En teoría no
 este descuento se aplica sobre la tarifa en la que puedes cancelar y te devuelven el dinero o cambiar de fecha sin coste extra
 Vale gracias

 Renfe website 🚆 or Alsa buses 🚌
 Or blablacar if you don't carry to much stuff with you
" The train is good bc for 20€ you can go all the times you want, but blablacar is also good option"
 How does it works? You have to do a subscription?
 Yes but media distancia isn't like cercanías. You can only choose one destination. If you choose Zaragoza you can only go to Zaragoza with that bono.
 True
" But either way, 20€ for round trip is a good deal"
" Same question but for Cordoba, it’s so expensive ahahah"
" not going is so cheap, tho"
 give me money
 it's cheaper not to give you money 🥰
 I can tell you're studying econ 🤑

 Also at night? Because cabify doesnt go past 12:00

 Latest one i ever took was at 1:40
 Taxis queue up at the airport basically whenever planes are arriving
 u can use uber or cabify too
" Xenet and Digi both of them have good prices.
And I think they are fixed. Not surprises there at the end of the promo"

" Hey guys, I wanted to go to Alicante but I saw that the trains and the Alsa buses are pretty expensive, does anybody know a cheaper solution?"
 You can check Blabla Car
" When you book the Alsabus some time before ( 2- 3 weeks earlier) and with the ESN discount of 15%, then they are not that expensive.🤔"
 But it's true?
 I did the one for the cercanias
" You can buy it in the renfe cercanias app (10€), and you can use it til the end of the year"
 What does it offer?
 You can travel in alm the cercania lines (c lines) until the end of the year (31.12.23.) with it
" Cercania lines, gets you to Madrid ?"
 Thanks
 But you can use it with all the cercanias or does it only work with one destination?
" I would like to know this information too, thanks"
 No
 But Madrid is usually just 15€ by train if you book in advance and takes 1 1/2 hour
 This are the cercania’s one
 All the cercanias yes
" I’ve just read that the one for medium distance trains only work with one city, for example “Valencia- Alicante” and that’s it… I was hoping you could use it for other destinations as well"
 Have you visited some of them? Do you think it’s worth it?
" Depends what your plans are 😅. If you like hiking etc. there are quite some hikes in the area reachable with cercanias. Often a roundtrip will cost you 7€ with a normal ticket, so if you plan to use it twice it's already worth it"
 Thank you! Btw if you wAnt to share some of the hikes I’d be interested
 I bought one for Valencia-Barcelona for 20€
 I bought it in Renfe customer point at Valencia Cabanyal train station

" Briefly, there have been a couple of things, but I wouldn't say anything to worry about:

- Fake bomb warning on the faculty of Telecomunicaciones of UPV - there is nothing revised by police
- A person with a gun in Cabanyal - just a fight between some groups 
- Supposedly, a guy with a gun around the faculty of Economía of UV - rumours
- Police arpund the city due to the basketball match Valencia - Tel Aviv on the Polideportivo Fuente de San Luis - just to prevent"
" Typical rumours when there is police and an event, nothing to worry with this information"
 When is the basketball match pls ?

Este sábado 21 de octubre ESN organiza una actividad donde primero por la mañana haremos un tour por el centro de València💜 y después os invitaremos a comer en el centro, en el Youth Council para que conozcáis como funciona en nuestro pais 🤟🏼🤟🏼
Por la tarde, iremos a un colegio a hacer una actividad con un GRUPO SCOUT! para conocer a jóvenes de 16 a 18 años y así que los erasmus que asistan puedan compartir un poco de su país y su experiencia como erasmus 🥰🥰 *TODO GRATIS*

" Buenas, hace falta tener esn card"
 Para asistir
" Is it possibile for the next esn trips, book flights instead of going there by bus?"
 6h to sevilla is way too much!
 I think it is way more expensive to book a flight for each participant than just one or two busses
" Well, let's say we book flights, then 1. the price would increase by at least 80-100€/person on average, meaning the participation fee would be much higher, 2. we would have to decide between booking priority and non-priority regarding the suitcases, meaning somebody would always be unhappy, either because they need it or don't need it, and priority would be even more expensive, 3. We would have to count on being able to book 50+ spots, which sometimes isn't possible because there's not enough seats left, 4. Going to the airport, flying and getting to the city takes in total at least 3h, if you count in potential delays it's 1-2h additionally, meaning you're already close to 6h
Simple solution: booking a bus, then everybody can decide what luggage to take, it's cheaper and it's only for us, so we don't have to fear not getting enough spots 🫰🏼"

 Hello everyone! Do any of you leave his room? I'm looking for one for January 🥹
 There is the platform rooms4valencia. There you can find one
" UPV: https://esnvalenciaupv.org/eventos
(Online payment available now, only to UPV students)"
 how far in advance should someone get a room?
 ill come end of january..but didnt even think about renting a place yet
 The sooner the better. You'll find more available in better locations and cheaper. I have always booked like 3-6 months in advance and for full year in summer. If you look for a semester only it is a bit harder to find and you will probably only find Erasmus accomodations. Hope it helps!
" hey guys,
in the flat where i lived for erasmus last semester, two rooms are becoming available. 
we are looking for two new tenants for the two rooms for the landlord from the beginning of January, preferably for at least one semester or longer. 
the flat, in which two other flatmates live, is right next to the Amistat metro. it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the UPV, 15 minutes by bike to the beach and 15 minutes to the old town. there is a market, lots of shops and turia park is very close.
we would be delighted if any of you are interested in the rooms and we can rent them out quickly. 
if you need more information, please write to me privately, then I can also send you pictures or do an online flat viewing."
