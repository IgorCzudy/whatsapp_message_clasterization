" Buenos d√≠as, algunos de vosotros practic√°is nataci√≥n y/o boxeo en la UPV, me gustar√≠a preguntaros alguna informaci√≥n sobre los cursos."

 You'll be able to come to our amazing trips and actividades
 Perfect thank you

 Until what time you are in the office please?

 One of the main discounts the card can offer is the Ryanair one: 10% discount in 4 flights and a free luggage 25kg max. Also you can check esncard.org and look for all the discounts you can get
 Yesss ofc

 No ideaü•≤. I'd recommend you to send an email to the university
 what are the opening hours of the ESN office to buy the card?
" It's on our Instagram, today is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."
 It depends on the university you go to
" I'm not sure, but I would say you start on the 11th"
" I sent an email, I hope they will reply soon"

 Oh without card can‚Äôt we enter? Or should we pay at the entrance etc.
 What if I went this morning take my card but there were too many people so I just got registered but couldn‚Äôt get it ?
 You need to register
 Oh sorry I thought you were talking about registering for the ESNcard
" no, i already got it :)"
 So no problem then
 so just show up with the card would be enough? :)
 Yep
" I registered online but at the office they told they were closing and couldn't get one, I suppose can't got to the party, right?"
 Is anybody still at the beach?
" No unfortunately not, but I probably will go tomorrow morning (around 10) if anyone wants to join"
 üòä
 YOU DON'T NEED YOUR ESNCARD TO ENTER BAMBOO FOR FREE
 Alright thanks
 And the other party as well I suppose
" Party at bamboo: free entrance, with the ESNcard you get a free shot, that's it 
Party at Indiana: with the ESNcard you have free entrance till 1:00"
" Hey, is there someone in the city centre up for a drink or walk around? We are two"

 Until when can I still go take my card a the office today ?
 Which uni?
 At the centro de idiomas
 Until 12
 Ok thanks
 Hey does anybody have an advice where to get your own bike from (long-term rent or buying)?
 at upv until 13? or did the times change?
 Yes! UPV Office from 11:30 until 13:00
 okay thanks:)
 I rented at MONBIKE starting from ‚Ç¨20 a month. It is a minimum of 3 months. I think it is a nice place.
 Where can I get the ESN bag?
 I asked at some bike/repair shops if they have a second hand bike to sell and most of them had some
 Do you know if it‚Äôs expensive?
 When you get an ESNcard they should give you one
" hard to say, really depending on the bikes‚Ä¶ But yes, some were too expensive I thought, but I found one in the end!"
" Maybe ESN has a discount with bikes, I know we had before"
 Take a look at the partners on the ESN web
 vuelta de turca was the shop but I think it was the last second hand bike they had available in the moment
" If anyone is interested, we will go at 2 pm"
" hahaha okay, but thank you!!!ü•∞"
" If you got the esncard with UV maybe we didn't have enough welcome packs at that moment, in that case we must have given you a paper with which you can come to our office to pick your welcome pack üòä"
" do you know if it‚Äôs safe to let your bike outside in Val√®ncia? i mean a second hand one, not too fancy"
 To get the esn card can I pay with card? 
 If you leave It with a lock It should be fine
 Good question
 Yes
" For the bike question, how is Valenbisi?"
 Do I have to pick up the esn card myself? Or can a friend pick mine up for me?
" I would only use a U shape lock grabbing the body and wheel, otherwise it's possible to break it"
 You can see the corpses of stolen bikes around the city üòÇ
 Nope..
 Exactly üòÖ unless you can lock EVERYTHING...
 Very nice but might not be suitable for going to university as they won‚Äôt be places to parc it
 There aren't many?
" Hi, I will be an erasmus in the CEU university 
Can I still get the ESNcard even if there is no ESN section in CEU university?"
 Yesss! You can!üòÑ
 üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
 Yes there are many. But keep in mind that many students use it and they all come at round about the same time to university
 where?
 in which sections?
" It's convenient to go around the city. But compared to a normal bike, it is quite heavyü§£"
" You can always check the app to see free spots closer to the uni.. but yeah, the closest are usually full"
 Dit bericht is verwijderd
 What do you have to bring to get your esn card? Just the money? üòÑ
 You can choose
 And id or passport if possible
" If you are from a uni without ESN, any ESN can make your ESNcard"
 Do I need my student card to register for the sport courses?
 Is the Upv office open this afternoon too?
 Yesss! From 16:30 until 18:00 üïê
 Anyone recommendations for getting a cheap second hand bike?
 Where can we sign up for the Montanejos Trip? Or is it already full?
 It's already full üò¢
 cash converters
" What you mean, there are valenbisi parking lots everywhere"
 And it's only 30‚Ç¨ for an entire year
 And you don't have to worry about it getting stolen
 Besides if you manage to arrive to your destination in less than 30 minutes it's free
 Otherwise it's 52 cents
 and we have to go in an office ?
 It's all done online
 Just need to download an app
 you can also just leave the bike at the station before you get to 30 min and then get the same one immediately hahaha
 Yeah exactly
 Valenbisi https://www.valenbisi.es/en/home
 Yes but in UPV/Tarongers campus it can be difficult to find a free spot in lecture days ü•≤
" This has probably been asked before, but do you have to have an Erasmus life card to join trips? 

It won't let me create an account, and was thinking about joining the Alicante trip tomorrow but I might be too late then."
 Take valenbisi for more or less 30‚Ç¨ you can take them wherever you are
 The city is full
" We are not that company, we are ESN, volunteers,, and you would need our ESNcard to join, yep"
 Maybe just go to their store or ask them via Instagram....
" Smart, thanks!"
" Sorry guys, is there anyone who wants to make a change of appointment for the metro card? Mine is September 18 but I will not be here so an appointment a few days later is fine too"
 Is that the free one ?
 Yeah only problem is you cannot always park them
 Yeah
 It doesnt matter if you dont come on the selected hours right? Cuz todsy I checked and you gotta pick the pickup point ajd hours yea?
 How do you make an appointment?
 https://www.metrovalencia.es/es/cita-previa/
 Thank you!
" Hi, if its possible i could take your appointment, i have one on the 2nd of october"
" They are everywhere, I am just saying that at uni the lots will be all taken during uni time or it will be difficult at least. That‚Äôs just the information I got from some officials :)"
" I'm not sure if you can exchange it, since they'll ask for your ID ü§î"
 Can I have the ESN card if I am not in the University of Valencia ?
 Yes
 Ok thanks
 Any tips on where to get a photo to put on the ESN card? üòÖ
 In the Amistat metro station there's a photobooth
" Also in Facultats, or at least there was one"
 if you have a photo on your mobile you can print it in rossmann
" If you go there choose the Vintage pictures, they're tinted but cheaper than the passport pictures and you get multiple attempts xD"
 That's the true spanish spirit hahahahha
" Hello, we've just arrived, we haven't yet done the ESN card. Is it possible to attend tonight's party at Havanas clubs?"
 What clubs can you enter without the ESN card? I don‚Äôt have it yet either :((
" You can go into the club, but you'll have to pay I'm afraidüòï. To Havana club today you have free entrance with your ESNcard until 1:00 am"
 I got a bike on wallapop App (like Ebay) for 85‚Ç¨ and it‚Äôs a beautiful road bike can recommend the app
 Someone on the beach?
" Yes, between number 5&6"
 Can you maybe send me your location?
 We'll be there in a few minutes late to the oceanography

 Do I need to have the ESNcard from ESN Valencia UPV to attend the events? I‚Äôm coming from another section and already have a cardü§î

" Ohh, okay greatüôà"
 Is the next possible time to pick up the card at the UV next Wednesday or is there a way to get it earlier?

 I think it‚Äôs through an Erasmuslife link
 Anyway it‚Äôs normally fridays and saturdays
" You will have to drop one of these and select new one on the university system, before you drop any of courses- you must confirm it with your home university, and get new LA signed from both sides. 

But, don‚Äôt worry first 2 weeks like orientation stuff. You join classes and try to change if you dont like(with home university confirmation,LA)."
 Hi everybody! Someone could tell me where is esn office and when it is open?

 Hi I've got this message when I looked up the ryanair discount in esncard.org:
 Is this because i just created the account or something else is the problem
 Is the climbing today a course or just climbing together?
 Becaue I think the entry is less than 13‚Ç¨ normally ...
" you are at ""the economist"" :) you have to go to the ryanair section"
" I'll explain, we're all going together, it's ‚Ç¨10 and ‚Ç¨3 for climbing shoes"
" it's climbing together, but for people who are not beginners
And the price is 13‚Ç¨ if you don't have an ESNcard and need to borrow shoes, which are 3‚Ç¨
Entrance is 10‚Ç¨ without ESNcard and with 8-9‚Ç¨"
 OH yes fair but the ryanair page is the same
 Ah ok great üî•
 Did you register your card?
 I am in :)
 write me in private
" the Ryanair part of our website seems to be down! But you can still access the discount! All you need to do is go to the Ryanair website, log in to your profile, click on the erasmus tab on the left side and then enter the same information that you entered when registering your ESNcard. After that you should have access to the discount ü´∞üèª"
 I study in another one so it‚Äôs not relevant?
 Not really
 Ok Perfect
" So I‚Äôll ask my friend that goes to UV to take it for me even if I wrote UPV, right?"
 But you have to go pick it up in the uni that you registered
" If you want to pick it up in UV you'll have to fill our form, that's it "
 Oh shit
 I put the wrong one
" It's ok, you can fill it again"
 Making the forms is a second
 Ok Perfect

 Hi
 I have got a question
" Hi! If I haven‚Äôt got a ESN card, I come without and buy on this event?"
 I cant go to your office because i have lessons
 ?
" Good morning everyone!
There has been some escape room scheduled today. Has it been canceled?"
 Noo
" But we've changed the location, its in calle de Sevilla 13"
 In cronos local
 And you can only come if you booked your spot previously
 Is it possible to book now?
" And if so, where?)"
 I dont thanks so :(
 We sent the participants yesterday
" Oh, gosh. Thanks. It was quite unclear that you should register and where to do it."
 I'm sorry to hear that
" But for most events that you need to pay for, you must go tp your ESN Office to buy it"
 We Will do another one the 24th so stay tuned for that one :)
 25th*
" Hey, does someone know in what building business English is held today? Aula 314 Aulari Sud"
 You can only buy the card in our office
 Maybe we'll open some afternoons so if you can't come in the morning just wait for next week's schedule
 Hi everyone! Does someone know how to sign for activities in UV? The enrolment starts today at 11 but I‚Äôm not sure if I have to do it online or in person
 Maybe someone also is going to take some sports activities and can help me ü•∫
" Hello!!, There is always a contact phone number or an email, you usually ask there to go to the first class and if you like it you can ask the teacher to sign up"
 But on the sports page I think you can sign up
 Ohh I don‚Äôt know how to do it actually ;(( I tried different ways. I guess I have to wait till 11? Idk
" I will try that way, thank you"
 You can look for different sport courses here: https://secvirtual.uv.es/p/pls/uv0/public_cursose.ofertacursos?idioma=I&wcentro=S32

 Hi! How does It work for signing up for up coming events?
" Hi, are there discounts offer on ASLA buses with ESN card?"
 you can log into Instagram stories or Facebook to see events and activities and there is usually a link if needed. And then depending on where you got your ESN card you look on the ESN website at the events üòÅ
 yesss
" I'm sorry but I'd like to sign for paella night but I can't
On the site I can only see 2 actividades (yoga aerial y art in the park)"
" paella is sold out sorryü´£we will do more international dinners, don't worry, but you can still come to the party"
 remember to sign up for activities as soon as possible so as not to miss out on a place!
" for example for painting in the park while eating we also have limited places, I recommend you to buy it as soon as possibleüòÑüòÑ"
 you get food and drink while you paint and meet all the other artists hahah
 https://www.esn-spain.org/partners/alsa yesss!
" The ESN UCV website has no activity, so where should I sign?"
 Nein
" I reserved a seat for aerial yoga but I couldn't pay since it's only in presence. Now I see from the ig story that it's sold out, so I don't have a place anymory since I couldn't pay. Is that correct?
If so, could you put the possibility to pay online? It's not very convenient to have to come to the office everytime since I'm not in the campus"
" We dont sell online.. but if you are never going to be able to pay in our office .. the boulder center offers the aerial yoga without ESN as well, so feel free to contact them on Instagram @camaleonboulder"
 All sections are working on the pay online option but it's hard because it doesn't depend on us. It depends on the bank. And banks are slow with paperwork 
" I had the same, so if I just signed up and got a confirmation via mail does it mean I got a place or only after coming by the office?"
" That's the thing. It's not as easy as it seems to add online payments. Until this course we worked with an app called Verse which allowed online payments,  buuut unfortunately for us, they closed the appü´†. So we're still looking for a new platform for it. We're so sorry for the inconveniences ü•∫"
" So, for now, the only option is visiting our offices in order to pay"
 ??
" Do you also require booking&paying in advance for the cinema tomorrow, or can I just purchase a ticket when I'm there? I can't find any information on that, also not on the ESN website"
 Only after you pay for it. In the Esn valencia upv website it is explained in the events page
" Is the oceanografic 22.09. at 17:00h or 11:00h?
The short infobox says 17:00h but in the text it's 11:00h"
 17:00h sorry
" Feels like I'm lost in the dark.)))
Could someone tell me, please, where I can register for the city tour on the 16th and the oceanographic on the 22nd?"
 Okok! Hope it solves! Thx for your work ü´∂üèº
" For the city tour you don't have to sign up anywhere, you go there and that's itüòä For the oceanografic, look on the website depending on which university you are at, enter ESN en UV or ESN Valencia UPV or ESN UCV and register for the oceanografic, then go to the office to pay"
 Gracias.)
 Would you mind sending a link of the page of the event from ESN UCV? Sorry for bothering you that much... I just (who knows why) cannot see anything on the site: it is just blank.
" Don't worry about asking! They will not have updated their page, try talking to them on Instagram or go to their office to ask"
" If anyone has questions, you can always go to the office to talk about any topic!"

That is why we would like to offer you a wide spectrum of parties. Not the usual Valencian mental image that probably you have of only reggaeton discos and pubs (they are perfect of course).

Next friday 15th we will have a Party in Indiana disco (Reggaeton & commercial) üîäüé∂ü™©üï∫üèªüíÉüèª
And saturday 16th meeting point at Espit Chupitos pub to play some drinking games and dance commercial music

but also...

Next weekend there's a üè† House Music Collective called ""The Basement"" that with ESN and your ESNCard will offer discounts in their parties, they made parties each time in different locations.

The first festival is this one:

https://thebasementxxx.com/webapp/tickets/#/en/event/dias-de-parque-by-thebasement-polo-fest--130483

Since most of you still don't have the ESNCard, we implemented another way to discount

and it will appear a special offer with 5‚Ç¨ of discount for the festival 2-days ticket.

 Ist there the Uni Sport?
 And at tarongers?
 The cheapest gym in Valencia is Forma Sport. Near to Blasco you have Forma Sport Leandro but Forma Sport Av Francia is also close and the equipment is newer
 With the ESNcard you have a discount in vivagym
 No I have Uni sport courses

" Hello guys, Hello today I paid the administration taxes of tuition, however the day of paying started on 7th of September, do you think I paid too late and they will cancel my tuition? Btw ƒ± am a master student in uv"
" The taxes referred to university card, scholar insurance and enrollment fee"
" And ƒ± dƒ±dn know that ƒ± need to pay on 7th, they sent me a mail on 12th  september"
 Free joining fee and 3‚Ç¨ monthly discount on the premium or platino membership
" Hello guys üôåüèº, 

does anyone know how to recognise a scammer when you rent a room from facebook?"
" Folge diesem Link, um meiner WhatsApp-Gruppe beizutreten: https://chat.whatsapp.com/DPPTew3CIfE56fBrQ7NxRy

For all people who are at Burjassot campus and study Biology, lifescience, pharmacy or something like that :)"
 Nah don‚Äôt worry
 Really? I am really anxious about it
 Are you a student of uv also?
" Ask him to see the room on person, if he doesn't let you see it maybe it is a scam"
 Also normally it's a good advice not to pay any money in advance before seeing the room.
 How much discount do we have ?

 Does the natura night get cancelled if it rains?
" Noo, you can come and have some drinks with us!"

 Do you have any issue?
 Let me know if you need help
 I tried to book but ESN of Valencia doesn't have a discount. Or at least I didn't find it
" Ryanair is an international partner of ESN, so if you have an active ESNcard you have acces to the discount"
" If you try to book, there's a list of ESN universities and I didn't find valencia‚Äôs"
 I think there's an issue with the Ryanair x ESN cooperation currently. Quite a few people don't seem to be managing to book flights
" ah, not sure which list you're referring to but anyone with an ESNcard can use the discount, as long as it's registered on esncard.org as well before trying to book flights"
 The problem I encountered was people not logging into esncard.org or not creating it with the right details
" I'll take a look in a couple of hours, thank you!"
 The 10% discount and free extra luggage also has some conditions in Ryanair's website. I think it said you have to add the esncard to ryanair and the flight has to be booked 28 days in advance
 I tried to put the ESN card into the Rayanair account but it gave me an error
" 1st step: Register on esncard.org
2nd step: fill in the same info filled on Ryanair's website"
" If you try to register on Ryanair first, it'll say your info doesn't match"
 Yeah i don‚Äôt know where to click to get to Rayn air via ESN?
" Go to your Ryanair account profile, then on the left side you'll see an  *Erasmus* tab"
 There you have to set the info you fill on esncard.org 
 done
 and then you use the *exact same* info on the ryanair website as well

 Sorry Im sure this question was already here but cant find it atm: whats the cheapest / best way to go to madrid and where to buy tickets?
" You can go buy bus or train, in my opinion bus is cheaper but takes longer. Also you have discount with your ESNcard with ALSA buses"
" Buses are not necessarily cheaper, I always go to Madrid by train. If you buy the tickets soon enough you can find them for less than 20‚Ç¨, especially if the trip is during the weekdays. I recommend Iryo or Ouigo, they're cheap companies, and this is the website I use to compare prices thetrainline.com"
 By train you can be in Madrid in less than 2 hours and it's more comfortable
" +1
I found train tickets for 11‚Ç¨ from one of these too and it was for the weekend"
 True I just never plan soon enough üòÇ
 Such true words ü•≤
" Hi, how can I take the appointment for doing the ESN card?"

 And then visit our office to get your card‚ò∫Ô∏è

 True

 You can check Blabla Car
" When you book the Alsabus some time before ( 2- 3 weeks earlier) and with the ESN discount of 15%, then they are not that expensive.ü§î"
 But it's true?
 I did the one for the cercanias
" You can buy it in the renfe cercanias app (10‚Ç¨), and you can use it til the end of the year"
 What does it offer?
 You can travel in alm the cercania lines (c lines) until the end of the year (31.12.23.) with it
" Cercania lines, gets you to Madrid ?"
 Thanks
 But you can use it with all the cercanias or does it only work with one destination?
" I would like to know this information too, thanks"
 No
 But Madrid is usually just 15‚Ç¨ by train if you book in advance and takes 1 1/2 hour
 This are the cercania‚Äôs one
 All the cercanias yes
" I‚Äôve just read that the one for medium distance trains only work with one city, for example ‚ÄúValencia- Alicante‚Äù and that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶ I was hoping you could use it for other destinations as well"
 Have you visited some of them? Do you think it‚Äôs worth it?
" Depends what your plans are üòÖ. If you like hiking etc. there are quite some hikes in the area reachable with cercanias. Often a roundtrip will cost you 7‚Ç¨ with a normal ticket, so if you plan to use it twice it's already worth it"
 Thank you! Btw if you wAnt to share some of the hikes I‚Äôd be interested
 I bought one for Valencia-Barcelona for 20‚Ç¨
 I bought it in Renfe customer point at Valencia Cabanyal train station

" Buenas, hace falta tener esn card"
 Para asistir
" Is it possibile for the next esn trips, book flights instead of going there by bus?"
 6h to sevilla is way too much!
 I think it is way more expensive to book a flight for each participant than just one or two busses
" Well, let's say we book flights, then 1. the price would increase by at least 80-100‚Ç¨/person on average, meaning the participation fee would be much higher, 2. we would have to decide between booking priority and non-priority regarding the suitcases, meaning somebody would always be unhappy, either because they need it or don't need it, and priority would be even more expensive, 3. We would have to count on being able to book 50+ spots, which sometimes isn't possible because there's not enough seats left, 4. Going to the airport, flying and getting to the city takes in total at least 3h, if you count in potential delays it's 1-2h additionally, meaning you're already close to 6h
Simple solution: booking a bus, then everybody can decide what luggage to take, it's cheaper and it's only for us, so we don't have to fear not getting enough spots ü´∞üèº"

 Hello everyone! Do any of you leave his room? I'm looking for one for January ü•π
 There is the platform rooms4valencia. There you can find one
" UPV: https://esnvalenciaupv.org/eventos
(Online payment available now, only to UPV students)"
 how far in advance should someone get a room?
 ill come end of january..but didnt even think about renting a place yet
 The sooner the better. You'll find more available in better locations and cheaper. I have always booked like 3-6 months in advance and for full year in summer. If you look for a semester only it is a bit harder to find and you will probably only find Erasmus accomodations. Hope it helps!
" hey guys,
in the flat where i lived for erasmus last semester, two rooms are becoming available. 
we are looking for two new tenants for the two rooms for the landlord from the beginning of January, preferably for at least one semester or longer. 
the flat, in which two other flatmates live, is right next to the Amistat metro. it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the UPV, 15 minutes by bike to the beach and 15 minutes to the old town. there is a market, lots of shops and turia park is very close.
we would be delighted if any of you are interested in the rooms and we can rent them out quickly. 
if you need more information, please write to me privately, then I can also send you pictures or do an online flat viewing."
